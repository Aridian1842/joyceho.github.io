EHR increasingly important source new clinical information insights diagnoses prognoses, and cost-effective patient treatment and management
formidable challenges EHR
EHR diverse array of data including structured information diagnoses, medications, and lab results, molecular sequences, unstructured clinical progress notes, and social network information.
reasoning based  concise clinical concepts (phenotypes) high-dimensional EHR. useful phenotypes capture multiple inter-related aspects patients associated treatments representative substantial portions patient population
 EHR simple phenotypes sophisticated and multifaceted ones.

data-driven approaches.
clinical concepts dimensionality reduction lower dimensional latent space.
interactions different data sources EHR are challenge to model hampering our ability  leverage traditional analytic frameworks.
standard dimensionality reduction techniques derive concise clinically relevant medical concepts.
develop clinically interpretable models for EHR data.

transforming raw EHR medical concepts minimal human intervention.
multi-relational tensor factorization approaches that generate concise clinically relevant phenotypes.
extract phenotypes succinct set of properties predictive modeling, onset of specific diseases to indicators of readmission or fraud.
state space model approaches to dynamic track a patient's cardiac arrest risk and nonnegative factorization  tensor to generate high-throughput phenotypes.
clinically interpretable models that improve on baseline approaches.

multi-relational tensor factorization approaches multifaceted, high-throughput phenotypes.
nonnegative tensor factorization model to handle multi-tensors to derive concise phenotypes, refine phenotypes efficiently knowledge feedback process, and develop a smoothed time-evolving phenotype stream.
proposed computational framework will provide powerful, data-driven, and interpretable approaches for transforming high-dimensional EHR into medical concepts.
